Updated 25/04/19 - Check list for the game:

 - Initialise the board -(Done)
 Obstacle square positions already decided.

 - Display the board -(Done)
 This was given to us in Liliana's code. It also marks specific places for the obstacle squares to be with an "X"

 - Initialise (create) the players -(Done, could be more efficient)
 I have made a function to gather a name of each player, assign them each a colour and take in the number of players entered.
 This function returns the number of players to the main where it is then assigned to the variable "numOfPlayers".

 - Initialise struct for tokens -(Done)
 This struct just enumerates a colour to a variable called "col".

 - Add push/pop functions for the stack -(Done)
 These functions will be used to add/take away tokens from each square as they move

 - Make a function to allow players to place tokens at start of game -(Done, could be more efficient)
 I got a lot of help from the slides for this so we may have to change it a bit later if we have time.
 Over half is my own code though, so it should be fine.

 - Make a function to play the game -(Lucy is doing this)
 I suggest we split up this function into pieces because it looks like it could get very big very quickly. Doing this might also just make it easier to read.
 Nearly finished, but not quite working. Eg: the players can't move their tokens up/down before moving another token forward

 - Enter the functions into the libraries -(Done)
 Basically this is moving the functions from the c files to the libraries so that when they're called, all you have to do is write "function();" like you would for "printf"
 Make sure to add "#include libraryName" when you're running the code after, or the complier won't be able to find the functions and just give errors.

 - Edit main to put it all together -(Mostly done. Can't really be 100% finished until we've created all the other functions)
 There are some function calls in here already to start the process, but as we make our own functions we will need to add them here in the correct order.

 - Implement the function to announce the winner -(Christelle is doing this - Done)
 This should keep track of how many tokens of each colour arrive at the far side of the board.
 Once 3 tokens of the same colour reach the same side of the board, announce the player whose colour that is as the winner.

 - Function to add to each player's tokensOnLastCol counter -(Done)
 We need to be able to count how many tokens of each colour are o the last column.
 This number then needs to be added to the corresponding player's tokensOnLastCol counter.
 My attempt allows the game to only run for 1 round before deciding the winner.

 I will add or take away things from this if I think of them, but for now this is it.
 Mark what you're attempting to do here so we don't do the same things.
